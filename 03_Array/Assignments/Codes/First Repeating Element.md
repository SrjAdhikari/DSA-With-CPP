# Question : [First Repeating Element - GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/first-repeating-element4018/1)

Given an array arr[] of size n, find the first repeating element. The element should occur more than once and the index of its first occurrence should be the smallest.

**Note:** The position you return should be according to 1-based indexing.

### Example 1

```plaintext
Input:
n = 7
arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6}
Output: 2
Explanation:
5 is appearing twice and
its first appearence is at index 2
which is less than 3 whose first
occuring index is 3.
```

### Example 2

```plaintext
Input:
n = 4
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: -1
Explanation:
All elements appear only once so
answer is -1.
```

### Your Task

You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function firstRepeated() which takes arr and n as input parameters and returns the position of the first repeating element. If there is no such element, return -1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)
```

### Constraints

`1 <= n <= 10^6`

`0 <= Ai<= 10^6`

## Solution 1

```Cpp



Time Complexity =
Space Complexity =
```

## Solution 2

```Cpp



Time Complexity =
Space Complexity =
```
