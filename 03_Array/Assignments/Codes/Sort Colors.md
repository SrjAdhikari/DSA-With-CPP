# Question : [Sort Colors - (LeetCode : 75)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/)

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

### Example 1

```plaintext
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

### Example 2

```plaintext
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
```

### Constraints

`n == nums.length`

`1 <= n <= 300`

`nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.`

## Solution 1

```Cpp



Time Complexity =
Space Complexity =
```

## Solution 2

```Cpp



Time Complexity =
Space Complexity =
```
