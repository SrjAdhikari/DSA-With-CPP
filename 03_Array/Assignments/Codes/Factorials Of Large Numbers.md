# Question : [Factorials Of Large Numbers - GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/factorials-of-large-numbers2508/1)

Given an integer N, find its factorial. return a list of integers denoting the digits that make up the factorial of N.

### Example 1

```plaintext
Input: N = 5
Output: 120
Explanation : 5! = 1*2*3*4*5 = 120
```

### Example 2

```plaintext
Input: N = 10
Output: 3628800
Explanation :
10! = 1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10 = 3628800
```

### Your Task

You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function factorial() that takes integer N as input parameter and returns a list of integers denoting the digits that make up the factorial of N.
